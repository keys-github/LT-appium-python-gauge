_Appium is a tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. It supports iOS native apps written in Objective-C or Swift and Android native apps written in Java or Kotlin. It also supports mobile web apps accessed using a mobile browser (Appium supports Safari on iOS and Chrome or the built-in 'Browser' app on Android). Perform Appium automation tests on [TestMu AI's online cloud](https://www.testmuai.com/appium-mobile-testing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-gauge)._

_Learn the basics of [Appium testing on the TestMu AI platform](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-appium-testing/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-gauge)._

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing App automation testing with Appium, you would need to follow these steps:

- Install the latest Python build from the [official website](https://www.python-gauge.org/downloads/). We recommend using the latest version.
- Make sure **pip** is installed in your system. You can install **pip** from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Clone The Sample Project

Clone the TestMu AI’s [LT-appium-python-gauge](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-gauge) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-gauge
cd LT-appium-python-gauge
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your TestMu AI credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-gauge) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-gauge).

Set TestMu AI `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME \
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```

**For Windows:**

```powershell
set LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME `
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Upload Your Application

**Step-3:** Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the TestMu AI servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"'
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""
```

**Using App URL:**

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'
```

**For Windows:**

```powershell
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{"url":"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk","name":"sample.apk"}"
```

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on TestMu AI by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Python test on LambdaTest.

**Test Scenario:** Check out [get_started.py](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-gauge/blob/master/step_impl/get_started.py) file to view the sample test script

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

```python title="driver.py"
        caps = {}
        
        # replace with your desired test capabilities
        caps['name'] = 'Gauge Sample Test'
        caps['build'] = 'Python_Gauge_LambdaTest'
        caps['isRealMobile'] = 'true'
        caps['platformVersion'] = '11'
        caps['platform'] = 'Android'
        caps['deviceName'] = 'Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G'
        caps['app'] = 'lt://proverbial-android'      #Enter your app url here
```

**Info Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.testmuai.com/capabilities-generator/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-gauge)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-gauge).

## Executing The Tests

1. Install the required packages from the cloned project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install -g @getgauge/cli
set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python    #for Windows
export PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python  #for MacOS/Linux
```

2. Run the following command in the directory where your project has been saved to execute your build.

```python
gauge run specs
```

> Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [TestMu AI App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-gauge).

> If you fail to run the tests, try creating virtual env and installing the dependencies in that environment to run the tests.
> Creating and activating a virtual environment

```
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
